  <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a Graduate student at Rutgers University pursuing masters in Information technology. I completed my bachelors in electronics and telecommunication engineering and during my last 2 years of bachelors, i was working for OrnaIt services, Jersey city, NJ as a QA Automation tester. Working as a QA tester, I developed interest in information technology field.
		
Armed with the education and experience I had acquired so far I was ready to pursue further studies. It was time to move from the professional arena in to the academic realm and acquire a Master’s Degree. Whatever I had learnt so far both in the classroom and outside it will enable me to face all the challenges I will encounter while pursuing MIS It will further broaden my knowledge base which will come handy while developing complex systems and software.

After completing my undergrad, I was interested to pursue my Master’s Degree in the field of MIT as I believed will not only enhance my technical skills but also help in improving my ability to research and analyze. The knowledge that I have attained during the first semester of my degree program at Rutgers so far helped me contribute extensively towards three projects. Also after noticing that the fact that every system in modern world uses data analytics I just always tried to put an extra efforts to grasp more knowledge carrying out research for my projects. Working on three data related projects which were data analysis, data mining and database management helped me to decide my career in the field of data analytics.
